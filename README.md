# Project 3 - *Flixster Pt.2*

Submitted by: **Chun Sheung Ng**

**Flixster** is a movie browsing app that allows users to search for information such as popularity and overview of movies. This app aims to provide a convenient environment for movie lovers to explore the next movie that may become their new favorite. 
In part 2 of this project, networking tools are introduced and real data were fetched from a third party server. Tab bar controllers and collection views, two of the most important tools in iOS App development, are adapted to presenting the details of movies.
